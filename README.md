# ZK-SNARK-Designer

## Overview
This project focuses on designing a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (zkSNARK) circuit using Circom and ZoKrates. The circuit proves knowledge of inputs A (0) and B (1), which yield a 0 output. This document outlines the process from circuit design to verification contract deployment.

## Circum Circuit Design
The zkSNARK circuit, expressed in a truth table, validates the following logic:

| A | B | X | Y | Q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Circuit Design and Compilation
- **Circuit Definition:** The circuit logic is defined in Circom, specifying gates and constraints.
- **Compilation:** Compile the Circom code to generate circuit intermediaries.

### 2. Proof Generation
- Use ZoKrates to generate a proof with inputs A=0 and B=1.

### 3. Verifier Contract Deployment
- Deploy a verifier smart contract on the Goerli/Mumbai Testnet to verify proofs generated by the zkSNARK circuit.

## Circuit Code and Steps

### Circuit Code
The Circom code defines the logical gates and constraints of the circuit.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Install Dependencies:** Use npm to install required dependencies.
2. **Update Hardhat Configuration:** Configure Hardhat for contract deployment.
3. **Compile the Contract:** Execute `npx hardhat compile` to compile the contract.
4. **Deploy the Contract:** Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts` to deploy the verifier contract.
5. **Verification:** After deployment, verify the successful deployment by ensuring "true" is printed in the terminal.

## Security Considerations
- Utilize secure practices such as storing private keys in a .env file.
- Exercise caution when deploying contracts, especially in production environments.
- Thoroughly test code before deploying to mitigate risks.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to implementing a zkSNARK circuit, generating proofs, and deploying a verifier contract. By following these steps, users can ensure secure and efficient verification of sensitive information while maintaining privacy and integrity.
